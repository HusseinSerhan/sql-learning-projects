# Initial Data Analysis Findings

## Age Group Analysis Deep Dive

### Transaction and Payment Patterns
1. 20s Age Group:
   - Balanced payment behavior (1:3 payment-to-purchase ratio)
   - Higher average credit scores
   - More consistent payment patterns

2. 30s Age Group:
   - No payments recorded
   - Lower average credit scores
   - Highest number of transactions

3. 40s Age Group:
   - Most balanced payment-to-purchase ratio (1:1)
   - Highest credit scores
   - Most conservative transaction pattern

### Key Observations
1. Surprising Similarities:
   - 20s and 40s show similar responsible payment behaviors
   - Median and average amounts are surprisingly close across groups

2. 30s Spending Pattern:
   - Shows highest transaction frequency
   - Lack of payments in observation period
   - Potentially reflects higher expense period in life cycle

### Limitations
1. Small sample size affects reliability:
   - Only 5 customers total
   - Short time period (4 days)
   - Few transactions per age group

### Potential Lending Implications
1. Credit Risk Factors:
   - Payment behavior varies significantly by age group
   - Credit scores don't necessarily predict payment behavior
   - Age might be a relevant factor in payment patterns
