# Initial Data Analysis Findings

## Age Group Analysis Deep Dive

### Transaction and Payment Patterns
1. 20s Age Group:
   - Balanced payment behavior (1:3 payment-to-purchase ratio)
   - Higher average credit scores
   - More consistent payment patterns

2. 30s Age Group:
   - No payments recorded
   - Lower average credit scores
   - Highest number of transactions

3. 40s Age Group:
   - Most balanced payment-to-purchase ratio (1:1)
   - Highest credit scores
   - Most conservative transaction pattern

### Key Observations
1. Surprising Similarities:
   - 20s and 40s show similar responsible payment behaviors
   - Median and average amounts are surprisingly close across groups

2. 30s Spending Pattern:
   - Shows highest transaction frequency
   - Lack of payments in observation period
   - Potentially reflects higher expense period in life cycle

### Limitations
1. Small sample size affects reliability:
   - Only 5 customers total
   - Short time period (4 days)
   - Few transactions per age group

# Recommendations

## Immediate Lending Strategy
1. Prioritize Credit Score
   - Higher credit scores correlate with better payment behavior
   - Use credit score as primary lending criterion
   - Consider higher credit limits for customers with scores above 720

2. Age Group Considerations
   - Focus on 40s and 20s age groups
   - These groups show more balanced payment-to-purchase ratios
   - Consider more conservative limits for 30s age group until more data is available

## Data Improvements Needed
3. Expand Data Collection
   - Increase observation period beyond 4 days
   - Gather larger customer sample size
   - Track additional metrics:
     - Payment history over several months
     - Income data
     - Length of credit history
     - Other debt obligations

### Potential Lending Implications
1. Credit Risk Factors:
   - Payment behavior varies significantly by age group
   - Credit scores don't necessarily predict payment behavior
   - Age might be a relevant factor in payment patterns
