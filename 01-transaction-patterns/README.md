# Transaction Pattern Analysis - Basic SQL Project

## Overview
This is my first SQL learning project, focusing on analyzing customer transaction patterns using basic SQL queries. The project uses a sample dataset that mimics what a financial institution like Capital One might work with (at a much smaller scale).

## Project Scope
- Practice basic SQL queries (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
- Analyze simple transaction patterns
- Focus on fundamental data analysis skills

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains two tables:
1. `customers` - Basic customer information:
   - Customer ID
   - Age
   - State
   - Credit Score
   - Join Date

2. `transactions` - Transaction records:
   - Transaction ID
   - Customer ID
   - Transaction Date
   - Amount
   - Transaction Type
   - Merchant Category

## Project Goals
1. Understand transaction patterns:
   - Average transaction amounts
   - Popular merchant categories
   - Transaction frequency

2. Practice SQL fundamentals:
   - Writing basic queries
   - Filtering data
   - Sorting results

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- GitHub for version control
- DB Fiddle for query execution

## Learning Journey
This is part of my SQL learning journey, focusing on building foundational skills for data analysis. This project represents my first steps in working with SQL and financial data.
